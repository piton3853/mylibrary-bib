abstract = {The events of the Arab Spring of 2011 have made clear the importance and potential efficacy of nonviolent resistance, as well as the field's inability to explain the onset and outcome of major nonviolent uprisings. Until recently, conflict scholars have largely ignored nonviolent resistance. This issue features new theoretical and empirical explorations of the causes and consequences of nonviolent resistance, stressing the role that unarmed, organized civilians can play in shaping the course of conflicts. Contributors demonstrate the importance of treating nonviolent and violent strategies, as well as conventional politics strategies, as alternative choices for engaging the state, show how gender ideology can influence which opposition groups use nonviolent resistance, and suggest that the causes of civil war and nonviolent resistance often differ. Other pieces highlight the role of public attitudes regarding whether nonviolent resistance and violence are employed, how experience with activism and repression by the state can shape activists' perceptions of justice, and how the perceptions of resistance leaders can influence strategic choices. Moreover, several articles examine the key role that security force defections can play in the success of nonviolent resistance, how micro-level nonviolent tactics can improve security in civil war, and how nonviolent campaigns can influence the stability of autocratic states. These contributions suggest that rigorous empirical study of civilian-based contentious politics (rather than only violent contention by armed non-state actors) must be incorporated into the conflict literature. Improved theory and data on the subject will help researchers and policymakers to shape strategies to support these movements when appropriate, and to manage changes in the international system that result from the success of nonviolent uprisings.},

abstract = {How have economic historians understood the role of politics in shaping country differences in economic development? An impres- sive recent literature can be sorted out according to the degree of ``human agency'' at work. At the low-agency end are perspectives that stress geography, which is unalterable, leaving little room for human action and hence no room for politics. At the other end are arguments stressing deliberate, self-aware actions, hence choice, hence a substantial role for politics. In between are arguments where some choice occurred in the past or at a specific moment, but little since then. What drives development? Two lines of argument are vigorously debated: explanations that stress human capital and ex- planations that stress institutions. Within each camp can be found variance on the degree of agency and hence on the role of politics. Both vary as well on how they envisage society and its interaction with both institutions and human capital.},

By unpacking institutional variation across states and by drawing attention to agency issues between leaders, key backers, and citizens, models and empirical studies of linkage help explain even such fundamental phenomena between states as war and peace. In addition, theories of linkage politics explain phenomena not envisioned under earlier unitary-actor state models. We address how the linkage literature explains war and peace decisions, the democratic peace, nation building, foreign aid, and economic sanctions by tying international politics and foreign policy to domestic political considerations.},

We take stock of this research with a focus on movements in democratic polities and the United States in comparative and historical perspective. Although most studies demonstrate the influence of the largest movements, this research has not addressed how much movements matter. As for the conditions under which movements matter, scholars have been revising their initial hypotheses that the strategies, organizational forms, and political contexts that aid mobilization also aid in gaining and exerting political influence. Scholars are exploring alternative arguments about the productivity of different actions and characteristics of movements and movement organizations in the varied political contexts and institutional settings they face. Researchers are also employing more innovative research designs to appraise these more complex arguments. Scholarship will advance best if scholars continue to think through the interactions between strategies, organizations, and contexts; address movement influences on processes in institutional politics beyond the agenda-setting stage; situate case studies in comparative and historical perspective; and make more comparisons across movements and issues.},

@book{huntington97,
abstract = {he Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order is an expansion of the 1993 Foreign Affairs article written by Samuel Huntington that hypothesized a new post-Cold War world order. Prior to the end of the Cold War, societies were divided by ideological differences, such as the struggle between democracy and communism. Huntington's main thesis argues, "The most important distinctions among peoples are [no longer] ideological, political, or economic. They are cultural" (21). New patterns of conflict will occur along the boundaries of different cultures and patterns of cohesion will be found within the cultural boundaries.

Part One: A World of Civilizations

To begin his argument, Huntington refutes past paradigms that have been ineffective in explaining or predicting the reality of the global political order. "We need a map," Huntington says, "that both portrays reality and simplifies reality in a way that best serves our purposes" (31). Huntington develops a new "Civilization paradigm" to create a new understanding of the post-Cold War order, and to fill the gaps of the already existing paradigms. To begin with, Huntington divides the world into eight "major" civilizations:

Sinic: the common culture of China and Chinese communities in Southeast Asia. Includes Vietnam and Korea.
Japanese: Japanese culture as distinctively different from the rest of Asia.
Hindu: identified as the core Indian civilization.
Islamic: Originating on the Arabian Peninsula, spread across North {\{}A{\}}frica, Iberian Peninsula and Central Asia. Arab, Turkic, Persian and Malay are among the many distinct subdivisions within Islam.
Orthodox: centered in Russia. Separate from Western Christendom.
Western: centered in Europe and North America.
Latin American: Central and South American countries with a past of a corporatist, authoritarian culture. Majority of countries are of a Catholic majority.
{\{}A{\}}frica: while the continent lacks a sense of a pan-{\{}A{\}}frican identity, Huntington claims that {\{}A{\}}fricans are also increasingly developing a sense of {\{}A{\}}frican Identity.
Following the explanations of the separate civilizations in the new paradigm, Huntington describes the relations among civilizations. Before 1500 A.D., civilizations were separated geographically and the spread of ideas and technology took centuries. Huntington argues that research and technology are the catalyst for civilization creation and development. By 1500 A.D., evolution in ocean navigation by Western cultures led to rapid expansion and eventual domination of ideas, values, and religion.

Twentieth century relations among civilizations have moved beyond the unidirectional influence of the west on the rest. Instead, "multidirectional interactions among all civilization" has been maintained (53). In other words, cultural influence is interdependent; western civilizations influence and are influenced by smaller, less powerful civilizations around the world.

Huntington then refutes the idea of a Western cultural hegemony and the concept of an established universal civilization. He states that "global communications are dominated by the West" and is "a major source of the resentment and hostility of non-Western peoples against the West" (59). The notion of a single, universal culture is not helpful creating an explanation or a description of global political order. However, Huntington also argues that as modernization increases cross-cultural communication, the similarities among cultures also increase. The key to this chapter is Huntington's severance of modernization from Westernization. While the world is becoming more modern, it is simultaneously becoming less Western, an idea he expands upon in part two of the book.

Part Two: The Shifting Balance of Civilizations

Huntington starts this section by arguing that Western power and influence is fading. There are contrasting views on the West's hold on power. One side argues that the West sill has a monopoly on technological research and development, military strength, and economic consumption. The other side argues that the relative power and influence of Western countries is declining. Huntington adopts the latter view and describes three characteristics of the Western decline:

The current Western decline is a very slow process and is not an immediate threat to World powers today.
Decline of power does not occur in a straight line; it may reverse, speed up, or pause.
The power of a state is controlled and influenced by the behavior and decisions of those holding power.
Also in this section, Huntington asserts the increased role and importance of religion in world politics. Religion is the societal factor that has filled the vacuum created by a loss of political ideology. Major religions around the world "experienced new surges in commitment, relevance and practice by erstwhile casual believers" (96). Huntington goes on to say that replacing politics with religion was also the result of increased communication among societies and cultures. People "need new sources of identity, new forms of stable community, and new sets of moral precepts to provide them with a sense of meaning and purpose" (97). Religion is able to meet these needs.

Chapter five, Economics, Demography and the Challenger Civilizations, discusses the relative rise in power and influence of non-Western countries. Huntington specifically focuses on Japan, the Four Tigers (Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore), and China as countries, which asserted cultural relevance through economic successes. "Asian societies are decreasingly responsive to United States demands and interests and [are] increasingly able to resist pressure from the U.S. or other Western countries" (104). The ability of Asian countries to successfully modernize and develop economically without adopting western values supports Huntington's assertion that the world is becoming more modernized, but less Westernized.

Muslim societies, unlike Asian societies, have asserted cultural identity through the reaffirmation and resurgence of religion. Huntington argues that the resurgence of Islam "embodies the acceptance of modernity, rejection of Western culture, and the recommitment to Islam as the guide to life in the modern world" (110). Religion is the primary factor that distinguishes Muslim politics and society from other countries. Huntington also argues that the failure of state economies, the large young population, and the authoritarian style of governance have all contributed to the resurgence of Islam in society.

Part III: The Emerging Order of Civilizations

During the Cold War, the bipolar world order enabled countries to identify themselves as either aligned or non-aligned. In the post-Cold War world order, countries are no longer able to easily categorize themselves and have entered into an identity crisis. To cope with this crisis, countries started "rallying to those [cultures] with similar ancestry, religion, language, values, and institutions and distance themselves from those with different ones" (126). Regional organizations have formed that reflect political and economic alliances. These include Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the European Union (EU) and the North American Fair Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Huntington also describes the idea of "torn countries," or countries that have yet to entirely claim or create an identity. These countries include Russia, Turkey, Mexico, and Australia.

Huntington discusses the new structure of civilizations as centered around a small number of powerful core states. "Culture commonality legitimates the leadership and order-imposing role of the core states for both member state and core external powers and institutions" (156). Examples of core states are France and Germany for the EU. Their sphere of influence ends where Western Christendom ends. In other words, civilizations are strictly bound to religious affiliation. Huntington argues that the Islamic civilization, which he identified earlier in the book, lacks a core state and is the factor that disallows these societies to successfully develop and modernize. The remainder of this section goes into great detail to explain the different divisions of core states throughout the world.

Part IV: Clashes of Civilizations

Huntington predicts and describes the great clashes that will occur among civilizations. First, he anticipates a coalition or cooperation between Islamic and Sinic cultures to work against a common enemy, the West. Three issues that separate the West from the rest are identified by Huntington as:

The West's ability to maintain military superiority through the nonproliferation of emerging powers.
The promotion of Western political values such as human rights and democracy.
The Restriction of non-Western immigrants and refugees into Western societies.
Non-Western countries see all three aspects as the Western countries attempt to enforce and maintain their status as the cultural hegemony.

In the chapter The Global Politics of Civilizations, Huntington predicts the conflict between Islam and the West to be a "small, fault line war," and the conflict between the America and China having the potential to be an "intercivilizational war of core states" (207).

Islam and the West

Huntington goes into a brief historical explanation of the conflictual nature of Islam and Christianity and then lists five factors that have exacerbated conflict between the two religions in the late twentieth century. These factors are:

the Muslim population growth has generated large numbers of unemployed and dissatisfied youth that become recruits to Islamic causes,
the recent resurgence of Islam has given Muslims a reaffirmation of the relevance of Islam compared to other religions,
the West's attempt to universalize values and institutions, and maintain military superiority has generated intense resentment within Muslim communities,
without the common threat of communism, the },

Inspired by Robert Dahl, we define a country as democratic if it satisfies conditions for both contestation and participation. Specifically, democracies feature political leaders chosen through free and fair elections and satisfy a threshold value of suffrage. After comparing our coding to that of other popular measures, we illustrate how democracy's predictive factors have evolved since 1800. In particular, we show that economic modernization variables have steadily declined in their correlation with democracy over time.},

abstract = {In this article, we explain the role of international law in the resolution of territorial disputes from 1945 to 2000. In doing so, we focus on three outcomes of interest. First, when do states choose to revise the territorial status quo through negotiations instead of force? Second, when are states able to reach a final settlement? Third, when do states prefer a process of legal dispute resolution (i.e., adjudication or arbitration) to bilateral negotiations? To answer these questions, we argue that when the legal principles relevant to the dispute are unambiguous and clearly favor one side, a law-based focal point will emerge. This focal point, in turn, facilitates the settlement process by helping leaders overcome distribution problems, a central obstacle in reaching a final agreement. We find strong and consistent empirical support for our hypotheses regarding international law and peaceful dispute resolution.},

abstract = {An influential line of argument holds that globalization causes economic uncertainty and spurs popular demands for compensatory welfare state spending. This article argues that the relationship between globalization and welfare state expansion is spurious and that the engine of welfare state expansion since the 1960s has been deindustrialization. Based on cross-sectional-time-series data for fifteen OECD countries, the authors show that there is no relationship between globalization and the level of labor-market risks (in terms of employment and wages), whereas the uncertainty and dislocations caused by deindustrialization have spurred electoral demands for welfare state compensation and risk sharing. Yet, while differential rates of deindustrialization explain differences in the overall size of the welfare state, its particular character-in terms of the share of direct government provision and the equality of transfer payments-is shaped by government partisanship. The argument has implications for the study and the future of the welfare state that are very different from those suggested in the globalization literature.},

abstract = {Despite the variety of statistical methods available for static modeling of plant distribution, few studies directly compare methods on a common data set. In this paper, the predictive power of Generalized Linear Models (GLM) versus Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) models of plant distribution in the Spring Mountains of Nevada, USA, are compared. Results show that GLM models give better predictions than CCA models because a species-specific subset of explanatory variables can be selected in GLM, while in CCA, all species are modeled using the same set of composite environmental variables (axes). Although both techniques can be readily ported to a Geographical Information System (GIS), CCA models are more readily implemented for many species at once. Predictions from both techniques rank the species models in the same order of quality; i.e. a species whose distribution is well modeled by GLM is also well modeled by CCA and vice-versa. In both cases, species for which model predictions have the poorest accuracy are either disturbance or fire related, or species for which too few observations were available to calibrate and evaluate the model. Each technique has its advantages and drawbacks. In general GLM will provide better species specific-models, but CCA will provide a broader overview of multiple species, diversity, and plant communities.},

abstract = {The spread, diffusion, spillover, or contagion of violent civil conflict – including insurgencies, coups, or other inter- nal armed conflict – across international borders is of great concern to civil war scholars and international security policymakers alike. For instance, great power military interventions are often predicated in part on the belief that if a given conflict is not stopped now, it may spread and destabilize an entire region. Nevertheless, our understanding of this phenomenon of ‘substate conflict contagion' is hindered by the lack of a comprehensive and accurate universe of cases. In this article I introduce an original dataset of cases and non-cases of substate conflict contagion between 1946 and 2007. The key difference between my dataset and other datasets of this phenomenon is that I require in my definition of contagion not only the spatial and temporal proximity of two conflicts, but also a documented causal link between them. After introducing the dataset and the process by which it was constructed, I show that substate conflict contagion by my definition is significantly less common than previous scholarship and policymaker rhetoric suggest, and that its correlates – and potentially the best methods with which to measure those correlates – are different from prior research as well. Policy implications are considered, and applications of this dataset for future conflict research are explored.},

Shedding new light on an ongoing debate, we argue that the critics have overstated the case against autonomy policies. Our evidence indicates that decentralization has a significant conflict-preventing effect where there is no prior conflict history. In postconflict settings, however, granting autonomy can still be helpful in combination with central power sharing arrangements. Yet, on its own, postconflict autonomy concessions may be too little, too late. Accounting for endogeneity, we also instrument for autonomy in postcolonial states by exploiting that French, as opposed to British, colonial rule rarely relied on decentralized governance. This identification strategy suggests that na{\"{i}}ve analysis tends to underestimate the pacifying influence of decentralization.},

This paper presents a formal analysis of strategies that can be used to deter overly passive and overly aggressive executives and a discussion of their side effects. The typically large amount of uncertainty means that the constituency must base its decision to retain an executive on the outcome of a conflict and not on its apparent ex ante advisability. This uncertainty imposes a cost on the constituency, who may remove an effective, "innocent" executive unnecessarily, and it also imposes a cost on the well-meaning executive, who may be removed from office after making the best possible decision in a difficult case. The mechanism necessary to deter executive adventurism also causes the paradoxical "gambling for resurrection" effect, in which an unsuccessful war that a well-informed principal would terminate is continued because cessation would, given the current state of the world, cause the agent to be removed from office.},

Using cases, contingency tables, and regression analysis, we find that war participants who use the modern system are significantly more likely to succeed in decisive battlefield engagements. However, the modern system does not predict victory at a higher rate than more traditional unit-level explanations for combat effectiveness, suggesting that it might function as a causal mechanism linking factors like regime type and material endowments with martial capabilities. Exploring the possible links between unit-level explanations of military power and the organizational-level force employment indicators, we find that more materially powerful states and democracies tend to implement the modern system at a higher rate than other types of actors, but more extreme autocracies also frequently adopt. Combined, these findings suggest the relevance of continuing to explore how organizational-level variables impact military effectiveness.},

But what about other sorts of IGOs, particularly those with no direct connection to human rights issues? This study employs cross-national data on abuses of ‘‘physical integrity rights'' for 137 countries over the period 1982–2000 to test the hypothe- sis that IGOs can promote the diffusion of human rights norms by pro- viding venues for interstate socialization. Recent empirical work on IGOs has suggested that this sort of socialization effect can play an important role in promoting democracy and can also lead to a more general convergence among states' interests. The results presented here suggest that IGOs can have a surprisingly powerful influence on states' human rights practices as a result of this process.},

abstract = {Although some rebel groups work hard to foster collaborative ties with civilians, others engage in egregious abuses and war crimes. 

We argue that foreign state funding for rebel organizations greatly reduces incentives to ``win the hearts and minds'' of civilians because it diminishes the need to collect resources from the population. However, unlike other lucrative resources, foreign funding of rebel groups must be understood in principal-agent terms. 

Some external principals---namely, democracies and states with strong human rights lobbies---are more concerned with atrocities in the conflict zone than others. 

Multiple state principals also lead to abuse because no single state can effectively restrain the organization. We test these conjectures with new data on foreign support for rebel groups and data on one-sided violence against civilians. 

Most notably, we find strong evidence that principal characteristics help influence agent actions.

520 {\$}a" States are more likely to engage in risky and destabilizing actions such as military buildups and preemptive strikes if they believe their adversaries pose a tangible threat. Yet despite the crucial importance of this issue, we don't know enough about how states and their leaders draw inferences about their adversaries' long-term intentions. Knowing the Adversary draws on a wealth of historical archival evidence to shed new light on how world leaders and intelligence organizations actually make these assessments. Keren Yarhi-Milo examines three cases: Britain's assessments of Nazi Germany's intentions in the 1930s, America's assessments of the Soviet Union's intentions during the Carter administration, and the Reagan administration's assessments of Soviet intentions near the end of the Cold War. She advances a new theoretical framework--called selective attention--that emphasizes organizational dynamics, personal diplomatic interactions, and cognitive and affective factors. Yarhi-Milo finds that decision makers don't pay as much attention to those aspects of state behavior that major theories of international politics claim they do. Instead, they tend to determine the intentions of adversaries on the basis of preexisting beliefs, theories, and personal impressions. Yarhi-Milo also shows how intelligence organizations rely on very different indicators than decision makers, focusing more on changes in the military capabilities of adversaries. Knowing the Adversary provides a clearer picture of the historical validity of existing theories, and broadens our understanding of the important role that diplomacy plays in international security.

From Duplicate 25 (Provoking Preferences: Unionization, Trade Policy, and the ILWU Puzzle - Ahlquist, John S; Clayton, Amanda B; Levi, Margaret)

Ahlquist, Clayton and Levi 2014
Ahlquist, John S., Amanda B. Clayton, and Margaret Levi. 2014. `Provoking preferences: unionization, trade policy, and the ILWU puzzle,' International Organization, 68:1, pp. 33-75.

Summary
* Q: Why is the International Longshore and Warehouse Union opposed to trade liberalization, when their members stand to directly benefit from trade?
* H: Individual attitudes to international trade are driven by broader identity concerns and networked relations, rather than rational economic self-interest.
* M: survey of 675 ILWU affiliates and 604 non-affiliates (i.e. workers in other industries) in the longshore locals of Seattle, Tacoma and LA/Long Beach
* R: Support for trade depends not on one's structural position in the economy, but instead on the organizations and networks (identity?) that one is involved with.

Theory
* Two possible explanations are proposed:
* Economic self-interest (i.e. conventional macroeconomic theory)
* Sociological explanations
* Economic self-interest:
* Argues that dockworkers are fixed factors, given their skill specificity, and so should conform to an R-V model meaning support for pro-shipping measures, and a convergence of views with the ship owners
* Derived from S-S they argue that as labour is scarce in the US, that dockworkers should oppose trade liberalization
* Sociological explanations:
* Organizational cultures of unions vary depending upon the positions on international trade they take
* Workers are more likely to have an opinion on trade policy if the union itself asks members to
* Longer membership is likely to lead to views consistent with the union


Research design and results
* Utilise a survey of ILWU affiliates attitudes to trade, 2006-11. 675 ILWU affiliates and 604 non-affiliates in the longshore locals of Seattle, Tacoma and LA/Long Beach
* A matching design was used and attempted to create a balanced subset from the two groups with comparable values on observable `pretreatment' covariates (age, sex, ethnicity, education level, location, and date survey completed)
* 28{\%} of observations are lost via this process
* Find that support for trade depends not only on one's structural position in an economy, but also on the organizations and networks in which they are embedded
* i.e. individuals do not come to their political preferences based on a private appraisal of their economic self-interest
* The position of workers in this union, therefore, is inconsistent with predictions made from both major classical models of the distributive effects of trade (i.e. S-S and R-V)
* Instead, attitudes appear to reflect broader union `corporate culture' emphasising solidarity with international workers
* This is particularly shown through longer-term members being more likely to have an opinion on trade, to favour restrictions on trade, and to oppose NAFTA
* Member's thus appear to have taken on a broader class-based perspective


Points to consider
* Similarly to Mayda and Rodrik (2005) it appears that individual trade preferences are generally a result of non-economic factors (though not support for S-S).
* How do individual preferences aggregate to the party level?

From Duplicate 26 (Access to protection: Domestic institutions and trade policy in democracies - Ehrlich, Sean D)

Ehrlich 2007
Ehrlich, Sean D. 2007. `Access to protection: domestic institutions and trade policy in democracies,' International Organization, 61:3, pp. 571-605.

Summary
* Q: Existing research has focused on the difference between majoritarian and PR democracies; Ehrlich questions whether a more general argument can be made.
* H: As access points increase, the costs of lobbying fall, and policy is more likely to be protectionist
* M: panel regression of data on 21 OECD countries from 1948-94
* R: support for access points theory

Theory
* Existing work has theorised that PR systems insulate policymakers from protectionist demands (as they don't necessarily represent a district) and thereby should be more inclined to favour free trade, resulting in the state having lower levels of protection
* Yet, this blunt measure fails to account for the several majoritarian states with low levels of protection, and fails to account for the high degree of variation
* Ehrlich makes a more general claim based on the number of access points, which are the number of policymakers susceptible to lobbying. 
* When access points are numerous, the price of lobbying falls as the access points compete with each other for the lobbyists cash
* Ehrlich argues that protectionists are more easily able to overcome the collective action problem than free-traders, this is because the benefits of protection are concentrated and the costs dispersed, but the benefits of free trade dispersed and the costs concentrated 
* Therefore, protectionists will be more likely to take advantage of the low cost access, resulting in more protectionist foreign policy when access points are few. 
* The definition and operationalisation of `access point':
* A relevant policymaker who is also either independent or represents a specific political constituency
* Relevant means they have actual or potential policy power

Research design and results
* Model:
* DV: `tariff' -- revenue received from customs divided by the value of imports (trade-weighted average tariff)
* IV: differs by hypothesis

* Hypotheses:
* More electoral districts are associated with more protectionism
* As this adds access points
* IV: number of electoral districts
* Empirical result: Yes
* More parties in government are associated with more protectionism
* Increases the number of access points through increasing the number of relevant policymakers (likely party leaders)
* IV: raw number of parties in government
* Empirical result: Yes
* Low levels of party discipline are associated with more protectionism 
* Low party discipline makes more legislators independent, and thereby increases access points
* IV: uses a proxy called `pool' which measures the extent to which electoral votes pool across districts. In PR systems, once the top-list member has secured a seat, all additional votes are added to party candidates lower down. This means that an incentive for the party to do well exists, and little incentive exists to cultivate a personal vote in the district. This is a scale from 0 to 2, where 0 is a national list PR system, and 2 is no pooling.
* Empirical result: Yes
* After controlling for the number of electoral districts, the number of parties in governments, and the level of party discipline, PR is not associated with any change in protectionism
* i.e. PR v majoritarian literature is underspecified theoretically
* Empirical result: Yes, PR has no effect once the above is controlled
* Bicameralism is associated with more protectionism
* When the two houses are elected differently this should create additional access points
* IV: dummy for `effective' bicameralism
* Empirical result: No
* Presidentialism is associated with less protectionism
* If the legislature delegates trade policy to the president, then the number of access points is reduced. The president is assumed to be driven by national concerns, rather than the particular economic desires of constituencies and is thereby less likely to be protectionist
* IV: dummy
* Empirical result: Yes
* Left-wing governments are associated with more protectionism
* Whilst trade lobbying should follow specific-factor model (R-V), party ideology has long time horizons and thereby more closely resembles the mobile-factor model of S-S, therefore, left-wing parties which represent labour are more likely to be receptive to protectionist demands in advanced industrial countries (which are capital abundant but labour scarce), and so will encourage protectionist lobbying when in power resulting in higher tariffs.
* IV: dummy
* Empirical result: Yes

Points to consider
* Operationalisation uses tariffs, even though the theory is about trade policy. Three issues with trade-weighted average tariff:
* It can change without any policy change
* Extremely high tariffs can prevent any imports of a product, meaning that no tariffs are collected
* Tariffs are only one means of protectionism -- non-tariff barriers are missed from analysis, e.g. quotas, voluntary export restraints, onerous regulatory regimes
* Would theory hold in non-developed states?

Connections across readings and future research
* The major issue is matching up individual trade preferences and voter choice, to aggregations at the state level. I argue that, with the exception of Rogowski (1987) and Hiscox (2001) who are explicit in outlining that their theories are about cleavages, not voting, the other five papers require much greater treatment of this linkage.
* Hiscox's argument that factor mobility can vary from high to low (supporting either S-S or R-V respectively), is insightful, but does not appear to have been adopted to any great extent in subsequent works.
* That said, his theory may be criticised for being agnostic on which theory has greater explanatory power. For Hiscox, I would suggest greater specification of what high and low factor mobility looks like, how it can be measured, and how it ranges, would strengthen the paper.
* Individual voter preferences are shown to not be driven by rational economic self-interest by both Mayda and Rodrik 2005 and Ahlquist, Clayton and Levi 2014, the logical next step is to ask how individual preferences map on to voter choice.
* Unfortunately, I suspect that other issues trump the issue of trade for nearly all individuals in nearly all elections, with perhaps only those that have recently lost their job (or fearing loss) due to international competition (or the firm off-shoring) being likely to consider the issue to have primary political salience.
* Unpacking regime type, in particular for autocracies, is a clear necessity for Mansfield, Milner and Rosendorff (2000), and it would be especially useful to assess this breakdown in light of Ehrlich's theory, i.e. how well does access point theory explain the trade preferences of nondemocracies?},

abstract = {What explains the effect of external intervention on the duration of civil war? The literature on intervention has made some progress in addressing this question, but it has been hindered by an assumption that states intervene in civil wars either to help one side win or to facilitate negotiations. Often, however, external states become involved in civil war to pursue an agenda which is separate from the goals of the internal combatants. 

When states intervene in this fashion, they make wars more difficult to resolve for two reasons. First, doing so introduces another actor that must approve any settlement to end the war. 

Second, external states generally have less incentive to negotiate than internal actors because they bear lower costs of fighting and they can anticipate gaining less benefit from negotiation than domestic insurgents. 

Through Cox regressions using data on the goals of all interventions in civil wars since World War II, this article shows that when states intervene with an independent agenda, they make wars substantially longer. 

The effect of independent interventions is much larger than that of external interventions generally, suggesting that the established finding that external interventions prolong civil war is driven by a subset of cases where states have intervened in conflicts to pursue independent goals.},

abstract = {What explains the substantial variation in the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) lending policies over time and across cases? Some scholars argue that the IMF is the servant of the United States and other powerful member-states, while others contend that the Fund's professional staff acts independently in pursuit of its own bureaucratic interests. I argue that neither of these perspectives, on its own, fully and accurately explains IMF lending behavior. Rather, I propose a “common agency” theory of IMF policymaking, in which the Fund's largest shareholders—the G5 countries that exercise de facto control over the Executive Board (EB)—act collectively as its political principal. Using this framework, I argue that preference heterogeneity among G5 governments is a key determinant of variation in IMF loan size and conditionality. Under certain conditions, preference heterogeneity leads to either conflict or “logrolling” within the EB among the Fund's largest shareholders, while in others it creates scope for the IMF staff to exploit “agency slack” and increase its autonomy. Statistical analysis of an original data set of 197 nonconcessional IMF loans to 47 countries from 1984 to 2003 yields strong support for this framework and its empirical predictions. In clarifying the politics of IMF lending, the article sheds light on the merits of recent policy proposals to reform the Fund and its decision-making rules. More broadly, it furthers our understanding of delegation, agency, and the dynamics of policymaking within international organizations.},

abstract = {Wars within states have become much more common than wars between them. A dominant approach to understanding civil war assumes that opposition movements are unitary, when empirically, most of them are not. 

I develop a theory for how internal divisions within opposition movements affect their ability to bargain with the state and avoid conflict. 

I argue that more divided movements generate greater commitment and information problems, thus making civil war more likely. 

I test this expectation using new annual data on the internal structure of opposition movements seeking self-determination. 

I find that more divided movements are much more likely to experience civil war onset and incidence. 

This analysis suggests that the assumption that these movements are unitary has severely limited our understanding of when these disputes degenerate into civil wars.},

abstract = {During the nineteenth century, states routinely defeated insurgent foes. Over the twentieth century, however, this pattern reversed itself, with states increasingly less likely to defeat insurgents or avoid meeting at least some of their demands. What accounts for this pattern of outcomes in counterinsurgency (COIN) wars? We argue that increasing mechanization within state militaries after World War I is primarily responsible for this shift. Unlike their nineteenth-century predecessors, modern militaries possess force structures that inhibit information collection among local populations. This not only complicates the process of sifting insurgents from noncombatants but increases the difficulty of selectively applying rewards and punishment among the fence-sitting population. Modern militaries may therefore inadvertently fuel, rather than deter, insurgencies. We test this argument with a new data set of 286 insurgencies (1800–2005) and a paired comparison of two U.S. Army divisions in Iraq (2003–2004). We find that higher levels of mechanization, along with external support for insurgents and the counterinsurgent's status as an occupier, are associated with an increased probability of state defeat. By contrast, we find only partial support for conventional power- and regime-based explanations, and no support for the view that rough terrain favors insurgent success.},

abstract = {The mounting evidence for climate change has put the security implications of increased climate variability high on the agenda of policymakers. However, several years of research have produced no consensus regarding whether climate variability increases the risk of armed conflict. Many have suggested that instead of outright civil war, climate variability is likely to heighten the risk of communal conflict. In particular, erratic rainfall, which reduces the availability of water and arable land, could create incentives for violent attacks against other communities to secure access to scarce resources. Yet, whether groups resort to violence in the face of environmentally induced hardship is likely to depend on the availability of alternative coping mechanisms, for example through market transfers or state accommodation. This suggests that the effect of rainfall anomalies on communal conflict will be stronger in the presence of economic and political marginalization. We evaluate these arguments statistically, utilizing a disaggregated dataset combining rainfall data with geo-referenced events data on the occurrence of communal conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa between 1990 and 2008. Our results suggest that large negative deviations in rainfall from the historical norm are associated with a higher risk of communal conflict. There is some evidence that the effect of rainfall shortages on the risk of communal conflict is amplified in regions inhabited by politically excluded ethno-political groups. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract Since the period of bank deregulation in the 1980s, deferred deposit loan operations, better known as payday lenders, have become commonplace in the landscapes of many American cities. At the same time, traditional banking facilities have become less common, especially in the inner city. Growing disparities in the type of and accessibility to credit in the inner city has generated calls for greater regulation to curb practices by payday lenders that critics claim disproportionately affect poor and minority consumers. Payday lenders argue that they serve communities neglected by traditional banks. This article analyzes the site-location strategies of banks and payday lenders in metropolitan Louisiana, and in Cook County, Illinois, and finds that disenfranchised neighborhoods are simultaneously targeted by payday lenders and neglected by traditional banks.

abstract = {International institutions are a central focus of international relations scholarship as well as of policymaking efforts around the world. Despite their importance, our scholarly literature lacks a widely accepted def- inition of just what they are. Instead, scholars have employed a range of largely nonoverlapping conceptions, contributing to a fragmentation of the literature and hindering theoretical cumulation. This essay seeks to remedy this unsatisfactory state of affairs. It first reviews the principal ways in which international institutions have been conceptualized and identifies their shortcomings. It then develops a definition that promises to be inclusive of what are commonly regarded as the most important institutional forms without losing analytical coherence. A final section discusses some of the concrete benefits that result from employing the new definition, both in improving existing scholarship and by suggest- ing valuable new avenues of research.},

abstract = {This article introduces a new dataset on post-conflict justice (PCJ) that provides an overview of if, where, and how post-conflict countries address the wrongdoings committed in association with previous armed conflict. Motivated by the literature on post-conflict peacebuilding, we study justice processes during post-conflict transitions. We examine: which countries choose to implement PCJ; where PCJ is implemented; and which measures are taken in post-conflict societies to address past abuse. Featuring justice and accountability processes, our dataset focuses solely on possible options to address wrongdoings that are implemented following and relating to a given armed conflict. These data allow scholars to address hypotheses regarding justice following war and the effect that these institutions have on transitions to peace. This new dataset includes all extrasystemic, internationalized internal, and internal armed conflicts from 1946 to 2006, with at least 25 annual battle-related deaths as coded by the UCDP/ PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset. The post-conflict justice (PCJ) efforts included are: trials, truth commissions, repara-tions, amnesties, purges, and exiles. By building upon the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset, scholars interested in PCJ can include variables regarding the nature of the conflict itself to test how PCJ arrangements work in different environments in order to better address the relationships between justice, truth, and peace in the post-conflict period.},

To date, most existing theories and empirical studies have concluded that such violence is highly counterproductive because it creates new grievances while forcing victims to seek security, if not safety, in rebel arms. 

This proposition is tested using Russian artillery fire in Chechnya (2000 to 2005) to estimate indiscriminate violence's effect on subsequent patterns of insurgent attacks across matched pairs of similar shelled and nonshelled villages. 

The findings are counterintuitive. Shelled villages experience a 24 percent reduc- tion in posttreatment mean insurgent attacks relative to control villages. 

In addition, commonly cited ``triggers'' for insurgent retaliation, including the lethality and destruc- tiveness of indiscriminate violence, are either negatively correlated with insurgent attacks or statistically insignificant},

To address that deficiency, this study analyzes the actions of the commission and its members' voting records in the 1977–2001 period. It establishes that targeting and punishment by the commission decreasingly fit the predictions of a realist perspective, in which naming and shaming is an inherently political exercise, and increasingly fit the predictions of a liberal “reputation” perspective, in which governments hold others to their promises, and a constructivist “social conformity” perspective, in which governments distribute and respond to social rewards and punishments. With the end of the Cold War, the commission's targeting and punishment of countries was based less on partisan ties, power politics, and the privileges of membership, and more on those countries' actual human rights violations, treaty commitments, and active participation in cooperative endeavors such as peacekeeping operations.},

We focus on disaggregation in three specific dimen- sions, namely the resolution of conflict data, agency in conflict data, and the specific strategies used in conflict, and we also discuss new efforts to study conflict processes beyond the use of violence. We look ahead to new challenges in conflict research and how data developments and the emergence of ‘big data' push us to think harder about types of conflict, agency, and the 'right' level of aggregation for querying data and evaluating specific theories.},

Abstract.This note critically reviews the research on the link between political systems and eco- nomic growth. Empirical attempts to capture this patent relationship have been met with mixed success. We conclude that the political variables used in these studies, i.e., democracy and political instability, do not adequately reflect the 'investors problem'. We suggest that a political variable that encompasses all kinds of potential discretionary state interventions would be more effective in explaining cross-country differences in economic growth.

abstract = {Theories of civil war highlight how relative power affects conflict onset, dynamics, strategy, outcome, and duration. Yet most studies of civil war have not been able to capture rebel power adequately and often rely on national-level character- istics to infer relative power distributions. 

This study addresses this shortcoming by using a troop strength measure to test arguments about how relative power affects the likelihood of civil conflict settlement. Drawing on the international crisis bargaining literature, while noting the inherent differences between interstate and intrastate conflicts, this study argues that the condition of power parity increases the likelihood of negotiated settlement and ceasefire. 

Weak rebels are unable to achieve concessions through negotiation since governments view them as minor threats. Yet governments have diffi- culty defeating weak rebels due to an emphasis on guerrilla warfare. 

On the other end of the spectrum, rebels that are superior to the government in strength are unlikely to settle given their power advantage. 

Strong rebels that can rival the strength of the government (i.e. they are near parity) can exact more concessions because fighting at parity exposes information about how long each side can hold out while escalating the costs of war, giving each side a greater incentive to negotiate and eventually seek a ceasefire or peace agreement. 

This argument is supported using data on 112 dyads in the post-Cold War period.},

The model yields the following results, among others. Increased nonviolent opportunity has a nonmonotone effect on the use of ir- regular tactics. Conflict has option value, so irregular campaigns last longer than the rebels' short-term interest dictates, especially in vola- tile military environments. By demonstrating lack of rebel capacity and diminishing mobilization, successful counterinsurgencies may in- crease irregular violence. Conflict begets conflict by eroding outside options, thereby increasing mobilization},

abstract = {Does United Nations peacekeeping protect civilians in civil war? 

Civilian protection is a primary purpose of UN peacekeeping, yet there is little systematic evidence for whether peacekeeping prevents civilian deaths. 

We propose that UN peacekeeping can protect civilians if missions are adequately composed of military troops and police in large numbers. Using unique monthly data on the number and type of UN personnel contributed to peacekeeping operations, along with monthly data on civilian deaths from 1991 to 2008 in armed conflicts in {\{}A{\}}frica, we find that as the UN commits more military and police forces to a peacekeeping mission, fewer civilians are targeted with violence. 

The effect is substantial---the analyses show that, on average, deploying several thousand troops and several hundred police dramatically reduces civilian killings. 

We conclude that although the UN is often criticized for its failures, UN peacekeeping is an effective mechanism of civilian protection.},

abstract = {Energy security is a fundamental requirement for national security, and global energy competition threatens to make Department of Defense (DoD) mis- sions increasingly vulnerable to the vagaries of energy supply. Dr. Scott Thomas and Mr. David Kerner argue that DoDs approach to energy security must accom- modate a highly uncertain outlook for energy resource availability. The authors argue that while U.S. energy security needs are currently met, the shrinking gap between global supply and demand draws the world closer to a tipping point at which competition disrupts social and geopolitical normalizing forces, and con- flict becomes likely. This analysis offers key insights into what a shifting energy security environment is and provides a novel theoretical framework for how the United States can best respond to it.},

abstract = {During his long and distinguished career, Charles Tilly addressed the problem situation he inherited from his teacher Barrington Moore, the situation that emerged in the middle of his studies, and the problems that arose later in his life. Moore's core themes were revolutionary classes, revolutionary violence, and the outcomes of revolution. As the 1960s and the 1970s gave way to the 1980s and 1990s, Tilly faced a different world-historical situation. So-called national liberation moments---violent and radical, communist and anti-U.S.---did not always win. And when they did succeed, radical politics was not particularly appealing. Tilly's final challenge involved rational-choice theory's drive for hegemony in explaining all outcomes---political, economic, and social---of macrohis- torical change. For example, could a systematic alternative to the major approach to contention and conflict---a bargaining theory of war---be developed? To address these changing problem situations, Tilly fashioned his own unique theories, methods, and domains of inquiry. A truly seminal thinker, he pioneered now standard social-scientific approaches to mechanisms, contentious politics, and state construction. To understand Charles Tilly is therefore to understand the last fifty years of historical and comparative social science.},

@article{Humphreys2005,
abstract = {The interpretation of the resource-conflict link that has become most publicizedthe rebel greed hypothesisdepends on just one of many plausible mechanisms that could underlie a relationship between resource dependence and violence. The author catalogues a large range of rival possible mechanisms, highlights a set of techniques that may be used to identify these mechanisms, and begins to employ these techniques to distinguish between rival accounts of the resource-conflict linkages. The author uses finer natural resource data than has been used in the past, gathering and presenting new data on oil and diamonds production and on oil stocks. The author finds evidence that (1) conflict onset is more responsive to the impacts of past natural resource production than to the potential for future production, supporting a weak states mechanism rather than a rebel greed mechanism; (2) the impact of natural resources on conflict cannot easily be attributed entirely to the weak states mechanism, and in particular, the impact of natural resources is independent of state strength; (3) the link between primary commodities and conflict is driven in part by agricultural dependence rather than by natural resources more narrowly defined, a finding consistent with a sparse networks mechanism; (4) natural resources are associated with shorter wars, and natural resource wars are more likely to end with military victory for one side than other wars. This is consistent with evidence that external actors have incentives towork to bringwars to a close when natural resource supplies are threatened. The author finds no evidence that resources are associated with particular difficulties in negotiating ends to conflicts, contrary to arguments that loot-seeking rebels aim to prolong wars.},

abstract = {The increasing density of international regimes has contributed to the proliferation of overlap across agreements, conflicts among international obligations, and confusion regarding what international and bilateral obligations cover an issue. This symposium examines the consequences of this “international regime complexity” for subsequent politics.What analytical insights can be gained by thinking about any single agreement as being embedded in a larger web of international rules and regimes? Karen Alter and SophieMeunier's introductory essay defines international regime complexity and identifies the mechanisms through which it may influence the politics of international cooperation. Short contributions analyze howinternational regime complexity affects politics in specific issue areas: trade (ChristinaDavis), linkages between human rights and trade (EmilieHafner-Burton), intellectual prop- erty (LaurenceHelfer), security politics (StephanieHofmann), refugee politics (Alexander Betts), and election monitoring ( Judith Kelley).DanielDrezner concludes by arguing that international regime complexity maywell benefit the powerful more than others.},

@article{Bahaug2005a,
abstract = {The empirical evidence from studies linking geographic factors like terrain and natural resources to civil war is generally weak and not robust to varying samples or coding procedures. We argue that these investigations suffer from a major weakness: although most civil wars are geographically limited to small parts of the host countries, the analyses rely almost exclusively on country-level data. We demonstrate how Geographical Information Systems (GIS) can be used to generate precise measures of space-varying factors at the scale of the conflict. A comparison of several relevant variables measured both at the scale of the country and the conflict demonstrates that country statistics are poor approximations of the conflict zones. An analysis of duration of civil war further shows that certain findings are indeed dependent upon the scale of measurement. We conclude by discussing how GIS and spatial analysis may be applied in future research to increase our understanding of location, duration, and risk of armed civil conflict. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This article explores how the size and complexity of local information markets influence levels of exposure to local, network, and cable television news, as well as exposure to talk radio, online news sources, and daily newspapers. Using multilevel modeling and spatial lag regression, our analysis shows that the structure and demo- graphic tendencies of local news markets are strongly correlated with patterns of individual-level news exposure even after controlling for individual-level demographic characteristics known to predict information seeking behavior. Moreover, we find consistent evidence of regional information cultures that influence demand for news beyond the impact of demographic and market-level factors.},

abstract = {This article investigates the supply side of women's political representation by focusing on how the election of female politicians affects the motivation of women to run for office in other units. The analysis relies on an original dataset of over 1,500 municipal elections in Switzerland, starting with the first election after the introduction of women's suffrage. In the first election in which women could participate, the election of a woman in a given municipality was associated in the next election with an additional female candidate in 10{\%} of its neighbors. The relationship decreases over time, fades away after sixteen years, and is driven primarily by new female candidates in units where no female incumbents are running for re-election. These findings suggest that role models are important for improving women's representation, but only in its early stages. This conclusion could be relevant for understanding the political representation of other underrepresented groups. Replication},

abstract = {Recent work suggests that multilateral security institutions, such as the UN Security Council, can influence foreign policy through public opinion. According to this view, authorization can increase public support for foreign policy, freeing domestic constraints. Governments that feel constrained by public opinion may thus alter their foreign policies to garner external authorization. These claims challenge traditional realist views about the role of international organizations in security affairs, which tend to focus on direct enforcement mechanisms and neglect indirect channels of influence. To examine these claims, this article investigates the first link in this causal chain—the effect of institutional statements on public opinion. Strategic information arguments, as opposed to arguments about the symbolic legitimacy of specific organizations or the procedural importance of consultation, posit that the effect of institutional statements on public opinion is conditional on public perceptions of member states' interests. This article tests this conditional relationship in the context of changes in presidential approval surrounding military disputes, using a measure of preference distance between the United States and veto-wielding members of the UN Security Council. Findings indicate that short-term changes in presidential approval surrounding the onset of military disputes in the United States between 1946 and 2001 have been significantly larger when accompanied by a positive resolution for a Security Council that is more distant in terms of foreign policy preferences. The article also discusses polling data during the 1990s and 2000s that support the strategic information perspective.},

We find that pro-trade preferences are significantly and robustly correlated with an individual's level of human capital, in the manner predicted by the factor endowments model. Preferences over trade are also correlated with the trade exposure of the sector in which an individual is employed: individuals in non-traded sectors tend to be the most pro-trade, while individuals in sectors with a revealed comparative disadvantage are the most protectionist. Third, an individual's relative economic status has a very strong positive association with pro-trade attitudes. Finally, non-economic determinants, in the form of values, identities, and attachments, play an important role in explaining the variation in preferences over trade. High degrees of neighborhood attachment and nationalism/patriotism are associated with protectionist tendencies. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The first part of the book discusses the reformulation of the basis of classical and quantum Hamiltonian physics required by general relativity. The second part covers the basic technical research directions. Appendices include a detailed history of the subject of quantum gravity, hard-to-find mathematical material, and a discussion of some philosophical issues raised by the subject. This fascinating text is ideal for graduate students entering the field, as well as researchers already working in quantum gravity. It will also appeal to philosophers and other scholars interested in the nature of space and time.},

However, studies in bargaining theory predict that alliances between militants would suffer from commitment problems. This study seeks to identify the conditions under which militant groups overcome these acute commitment problems and form alliances. Two game theory models of alliances amongst militants are presented, the first capturing bilateral co-operation, and the second under conditions of asymmetry. It may be concluded that while militants less susceptible to government repression should prefer bilateral alliances, vulnerable militants are more likely to form asymmetric alliances involving state sponsors. Following the theoretical predictions, the theory is tested empirically using the UCDP/PRIO data.},

Instead, the idea of the state should be treated as a category of practice and not as a category of analysis. Post-colonial state formation could then be analysed by focusing on the inter-relationship between the idea of the state and actual state practices, and on the ways that states have become linked to domestic society on the one hand and their relations with the external world on the other.},

This article argues that conflicts with multiple actors who must approve a settlement (veto players) are longer because there are fewer acceptable agreements, information asymmetries are more acute, and shifting alliances and incentives to hold out make negotiation more difficult. 

This veto player approach to explaining variation in civil war duration is tested using a new dataset containing monthly data on all parties to each civil war begun since World War II. The statistical analysis shows a strong correlation between the number of veto players and the duration of civil war.},

Institutional arguments frequently imply that the relationship between political inputs and outcomes varies depending on the institutional context. Models of strategic interaction typically produce conditional hypotheses as well. Although conditional hypotheses are ubiquitous in political science and multiplicative interaction models have been found to capture their intuition quite well, a survey of the top three political science journals from 1998 to 2002 suggests that the execution of these models is often flawed and inferential errors are common. We believe that considerable progress in our understanding of the political world can occur if scholars follow the simple checklist of dos and don'ts for using multiplicative interaction models presented in this article. Only 10{\%} of the articles in our survey followed the checklist.},

The leading practitioners of the structuralist approach to contentious politics—McAdam, Tarrow, and Tilly—have jointly systematized their ideas. This synthesis, which I call Synthetic Political Opportunity Theory (SPOT), exerts domination and hegemony over the field. Its upstart rational action chal- lenger is theCollectiveActionResearch Program (CARP). I outline the basic presuppositions of SPOT and CARP and describe their different approaches to the structure-action problemof constituting social order. I then explore the potential of a CARP-SPOT consortium. I conclude that synergisms of the perspectives are possible but that trade-offs are inevitable: strong on action, weak on structure and vice versa; strong on resistance,weak on authority and vice versa; and strong on protest, weak on America and vice versa. Hence, we need creative confrontations, which should include well-defined combi- nations rather than grand syntheses, of rationalist and structuralist approaches to contentious politics.},

@article{gartzke13,
abstract = {The past half century has seen a dramatic rise in both the number of intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) and in participation levels by states and other actors. This exponential growth has been tracked increasingly through the collection and analysis of quantitative data. Some data collections can be divided according to the major subfields of international relations (security, international political economy), while others focus on the chief institutions (United Nations, European Union, International Monetary Fund, World Trade Organization). Much less attention has been devoted to collecting data on minor IOs, or to specialty organizations, which are no doubt worthy of additional scrutiny. In addition, very little large data collection efforts exists for regional IOs (with the notable exception of the European Union), as well as international non-governmental organizations.

The probably most integrated database on intergovernmental organizations is the COW IGO dataset. This contribution focuses on a description of the COW IGO database as well as a discussion of applications of this database in the academic literature. Our main goal is to provide a summary of the insights that have been gained from analyzing the COW IGO dataset. We then briefly summarize other datasets that are specific to important individual international governmental organizations. Here, we focus particularly on the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, and the World Bank (as well as other multilateral aid institutions). Based on these insights, we outline areas of future possible data collection or where datasets could be exploited for further analysis. We conclude by noting both the enormous successes of this literature and challenges to growth.

We should note that this essay is not designed to be an exhaustive catalogue of available sources, studies and their findings, but rather an informative (and hopefully useful) point of departure. We apologize in advance both to authors and readers for the many sources we will have omitted from the essay.},

First, the proliferation of civil war in the 1990's was not caused by the end of the Cold War. Second, ethnic and religious diversity are not the cause of a greater degree of civil war onset. Lastly, they argue one cannot predict where a civil war will break out by looking at grievances in a society. Instead, they offer that weak central governments render insurgency more feasible.

A host of factors contribute to the onset of insurgency. Weak police and counterinsurgent capabilities, rebel knowledge of rough terrain, and a large population. $\backslash$citeasnoun{\{}fearon03{\}} control for multiple variables and offer ten main hypotheses, including eight sub-hypotheses for H10.

abstract = {Does ethnicity matter for explaining violence during civil wars? I exploit variation in the identity of soldiers who conducted so-called “sweep” operations (zachistki) in Chechnya (2000–5) as an empirical strategy for testing the link between ethnicity and violence. Evidence suggests that the intensity and timing of insurgent attacks are conditional on who “swept” a particular village. For example, attacks decreased by about 40{\%} after pro-Russian Chechen sweeps relative to similar Russian-only operations. These changes are difficult to reconcile with notions of Chechen solidarity or different tactical choices. Instead, evidence, albeit tentative, points toward the existence of a wartime “coethnicity advantage.” Chechen soldiers, enmeshed in dense intraethnic networks, are better positioned to identify insurgents within the population and to issue credible threats against civilians for noncooperation. A second mechanism—prior experience as an insurgent—may also be at work. These findings suggest new avenues of research investigating the conditional effects of violence in civil wars.},

abstract = {The existing literature identifies natural resource wealth as a major determinant of civil war. The dominant causal link is that resources provide finance and motive (the “looting rebels” model). Others see natural resources as causing “political Dutch disease,”which in turn weakens state capacity (the “state capacity” model). In the looting rebels model, resource wealth first increases, but then decreases the risk for civil war as very large wealth enables governments to constrain rebels, whereas in the state capacity model, large resource wealth is unambiguously related to higher risk of war. This research note uses a new dataset on natural resource rents that are disaggregated as mineral and energy rents for addressing the resources-conflict relationship. We find that neither a dummy variable for major oil exporters nor our resource rents variables predict civil war onset with a 1000-battle-death threshold coded by Fearon and Laitin (2003) in the period after 1970 for which rents data are available. However, using a lower threshold of 25 battle deaths, we find that energy wealth, but not mineral wealth, increases the risk for civil war onset.We find no evidence for a nonlinear relationship between either type of resources and civil war onset. The results tentatively support theories built around state capacity models and provide evidence against the looting rebels model of civil war onset.},

abstract = {During the nineteenth century, states routinely defeated insurgent foes. Over the twentieth century, however, this pattern reversed itself, with states increasingly less likely to defeat insurgents or avoid meeting at least some of their demands. What accounts for this pattern of outcomes in counterinsurgency (COIN) wars? We argue that increasing mechanization within state militaries after World War I is primarily responsible for this shift. Unlike their nineteenth-century predecessors, modern militaries possess force structures that inhibit information collection among local populations. This not only complicates the process of sifting insurgents from noncombatants but increases the difficulty of selectively applying rewards and punishment among the fence-sitting population. Modern militaries may therefore inadvertently fuel, rather than deter, insurgencies. We test this argument with a new data set of 286 insurgencies (1800–2005) and a paired comparison of two U.S. Army divisions in Iraq (2003–2004). We find that higher levels of mechanization, along with external support for insurgents and the counterinsurgent's status as an occupier, are associated with an increased probability of state defeat. By contrast, we find only partial support for conventional power- and regime-based explanations, and no support for the view that rough terrain favors insurgent success.},

abstract = {Many observers heralded the Security Council--sanctioned intervention in Libya in March 2011 as evidence of the efficacy of the responsibility to protect (R2P). Although there is no doubt that the intervention was significant, the implications of Resolution 1973 are not as profound as some have claimed. The intervention certainly coheres with the spirit of R2P, but it is possible to situate it in the context of a trajectory of Security Council responses to large-scale intrastate crises that predate the emergence of R2P. This trajectory is a function of the decisionmaking of the five permanent members of the Security Council (P5), a group guided by politics and pragmatism rather than principles. As a consequence, the Security Council's record in dealing with intrastate crises is characterized by a preponderance of inertia punctuated by aberrant flashes of resolve and timely action impelled by the occasional coincidence of interests and humanitarian need, rather than an adherence to either law or norms. The underlying factors that contributed to this record of inconsistency--primarily the P5's veto power--remain post-Libya, and thus the international response to intrastate crises likely will continue to be inconsistent.

The third and most recent wave also reflects a resurgence in peacekeeping but is newly concerned with systematic and methodologically rigorous analysis (both quantitative and qualitative) of basic empirical questions about the effects of peacekeeping and the sources of peacekeeping out- comes. Recent empirical studies have demonstrated peacekeeping's effectiveness in maintaining peace, but related questions persist con- cerning the use of force, transitional administrations, which organi- zations most effectively keep peace, perspectives of the ``peacekept,'' and effects on democratization.},

abstract = {Five factors are shown to be strongly related to civil war duration. Civil wars emerging from coups or revolutions tend to be short. Civil wars in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union have also tended to be relatively brief, as have anti-colonial wars. 

By contrast, `sons of the soil' wars that typically involve land conflict between a peripheral ethnic minority and state-supported migrants of a dominant ethnic group are on average quite long-lived. 

So are conflicts in which a rebel group derives major funding from contraband such as opium, diamonds, or coca. The article seeks to explain these regularities, developing a game model focused on the puzzle of what prevents negotiated settlements to long running, destructive civil wars for which conflicting military expectations are an implausible expla- nation. 

In the model, regional autonomy deals may be unreachable when fluctuations in state strength undermine the government's ability to commit. 

The commitment problem binds harder when the center has an enduring political or economic interest in expansion into the periphery, as in `sons of the soil' wars, and when either government or rebels are able to earn some income during a conflict despite the costs of fighting, as in the case of contraband funding.},

abstract = {Abstract Abstract: Although many features of bilateral investment treaties (bit s) are consistent from one agreement to the next, a closer look reveals that the treaties exhibit considerable variation in terms of their enforcement provisions, which legal scholars have singled out as the central component of the treaties. An original data set is compiled that captures three important treaty-design differences: whether the parties consent in advance to international arbitration, whether they allow treaty obligations to be enforced before an institutionalized arbitration body, and how many arbitration options are specified for enforcement. Drawing upon several relevant literatures on international institutions, three potentially generalizable explanations for this important treaty variation are articulated and tested. The strongest support is found for the theoretical perspective that emphasizes the bargaining power and preferences of capital-exporting states, which use the treaties to codify strong, credible investor protections in all their treaties. Empirical tests consistently reveal that treaties contain strong enforcement provisions—in which the parties preconsent to multiple, often institutionalized arbitration options—when the capital-exporting treaty partner has considerable bargaining power and contains domestic actors that prefer such arrangements, such as large multinational corporations or right-wing governments. In contrast, there is no evidence to support the popular hands-tying explanation, which predicts that investment-seeking states with the most severe credibility problems, due to poor reputations or weak domestic institutions, will bind themselves to treaties with stronger investment protections. Likewise, little support is found for explanations derived from the project on the rational design of international institutions, which discounts the identities and preferences of the treaty partners and instead emphasizes the structural conditions they jointly face. In sum, this foundational study of differences across investment treaties suggests that the design of treaties is driven by powerful states, which include elements in the treaties that serve their interests, regardless of the treaty partner or the current strategic setting.},

Summary. --- Convergence of national GDP/capita numbers is a common, but narrow, measure of global success or failure in development. This paper takes a broader range of quality of life vari- ables covering health, education, rights and infrastructure and examines if they are converging across countries. It finds that these measures are converging as a rule and (where we have data) that they have been converging for some time. The paper turns to a discussion of what might be driving convergence in quality of life even as incomes diverge, and what this might mean for the donor community.},

abstract = {A dictator's motivation for using repression is fairly clear, but why some repress more than others or favor particular types of repressive strategies is less obvious. Using statistical analysis, this article demonstrates that a dictator's reliance on co-optation fundamentally alters how repression is used. Specifically, it finds that co- optation through the use of political parties and a legislature creates incentives that lead dictators to decrease empowerment rights restrictions, like censorship, while increasing physical integrity rights violations, like tor- ture and political imprisonment. This occurs because, by creating parties and a legislature, a dictator draws his potential opposition out of the general public and into state institutions, making it easier to identify who these opponents are, to monitor their activities, and to gauge the extent of their popular support. This reduces the need to impose broad types of repressive measures, like empowerment rights restrictions, that breed discontent within the overall population. At the same time, co-optation creates the risk that rivals, once co-opted, will use their positions within the system to build their own bases of support from which to seek the dictator's over- throw, generating incentives for dictators to increase physical integrity violations to limit the threat posed by these individuals},

Summary
* Q: Why is the International Longshore and Warehouse Union opposed to trade liberalization, when their members stand to directly benefit from trade?
* H: Individual attitudes to international trade are driven by broader identity concerns and networked relations, rather than rational economic self-interest.
* M: survey of 675 ILWU affiliates and 604 non-affiliates (i.e. workers in other industries) in the longshore locals of Seattle, Tacoma and LA/Long Beach
* R: Support for trade depends not on one's structural position in the economy, but instead on the organizations and networks (identity?) that one is involved with.

Theory
* Two possible explanations are proposed:
* Economic self-interest (i.e. conventional macroeconomic theory)
* Sociological explanations
* Economic self-interest:
* Argues that dockworkers are fixed factors, given their skill specificity, and so should conform to an R-V model meaning support for pro-shipping measures, and a convergence of views with the ship owners
* Derived from S-S they argue that as labour is scarce in the US, that dockworkers should oppose trade liberalization
* Sociological explanations:
* Organizational cultures of unions vary depending upon the positions on international trade they take
* Workers are more likely to have an opinion on trade policy if the union itself asks members to
* Longer membership is likely to lead to views consistent with the union


Research design and results
* Utilise a survey of ILWU affiliates attitudes to trade, 2006-11. 675 ILWU affiliates and 604 non-affiliates in the longshore locals of Seattle, Tacoma and LA/Long Beach
* A matching design was used and attempted to create a balanced subset from the two groups with comparable values on observable `pretreatment' covariates (age, sex, ethnicity, education level, location, and date survey completed)
* 28{\%} of observations are lost via this process
* Find that support for trade depends not only on one's structural position in an economy, but also on the organizations and networks in which they are embedded
* i.e. individuals do not come to their political preferences based on a private appraisal of their economic self-interest
* The position of workers in this union, therefore, is inconsistent with predictions made from both major classical models of the distributive effects of trade (i.e. S-S and R-V)
* Instead, attitudes appear to reflect broader union `corporate culture' emphasising solidarity with international workers
* This is particularly shown through longer-term members being more likely to have an opinion on trade, to favour restrictions on trade, and to oppose NAFTA
* Member's thus appear to have taken on a broader class-based perspective


Points to consider
* Similarly to Mayda and Rodrik (2005) it appears that individual trade preferences are generally a result of non-economic factors (though not support for S-S).
* How do individual preferences aggregate to the party level?},

abstract = {During the past few decades governments have signed nearly 2,700 bilateral investment treaties (BITs) with one another in an attempt to attract greater levels of foreign direct investment (FDI). By signing BITs, which contain strong enforcement provisions, investment-seeking governments are thought to more credibly commit to protecting whatever FDI they receive, which in turn should lead to increased confidence among investors and ultimately greater FDI inflows. Our unique argument is that the ability of BITs to increase FDI is contingent on the subsequent good behavior of the governments who sign them. BITs should increase FDI only if governments actually follow through on their BIT commitments; that is, if they comply with the treaties. BITs allow investors to pursue alleged treaty violations through arbitration venues like the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), a heavily utilized and widely observed arbitral institution that is part of the World Bank. Being taken before ICSID, then, conveys negative information about a host country's behavior to the broader investment community, which could result in a sizeable loss of future FDI into that country. We test these contingent effects of BITs using cross-sectional, time-series analyses on all non-OECD countries during a period spanning 1984–2007. We find that BITs do increase FDI into countries that sign them, but only if those countries are not subsequently challenged before ICSID. On the other hand, governments suffer notable losses of FDI when they are taken before ICSID and suffer even greater losses when they lose an ICSID dispute.},

We construct and analyze a new dataset of geo-referenced politically relevant ethnic groups, covering the entire world during the period from 1951 through 2005. Our results show that the conflict probability of marginalized groups increases with the demographic power balance compared to the group(s) in power. Furthermore, the risk of conflict increases with the distance from the group to the capital, and the roughness of the terrain in the group's settlement area. We also find that while the results for demographic group strength hold for all ethnic civil wars, the geographic factors apply for territorial ethnic conflicts only.},

abstract = {Doug McAdam, Sidney Tarrow, and Charles Tilly's (MTT) Dynamics of Contention is a major achievement in conflict studies and indeed the social sciences. Their goal is to ``treat social interaction, social ties, communication, and conversation not merely as expressions of structure, rationality, consciousness, or culture but as active sites of creation and change. We have come to think of interpersonal networks, interpersonal communication, and various forms of continuous negotiation---including the negotiation of identities---as figuring centrally in the dynamics of contention'' (McAdam et al. 2001 p. 22). Contention is thus innovative: it turns conventional social action into contentious politics. Contention is dynamic: multiple streams of conflict and cooperation come together. Most importantly, contention is relational: a society of individuals, and neither just individuals nor just society, characterize contention.$\backslash$nMTT are less interested in determining which variables matter in a regression equation than in exploring how these constructive social processes operate. While they suggest that variables are most often a poor substitute and shallow stand-in for the causal mechanisms that account for the dynamics, relations, and innovations that give contention its most interesting and important features, their measurement models of mechanisms of contention could potentially turn constructivist insights into hypotheses, causal accounts, and research designs. MTT thus offer us positivist constructivism---a third way between positivist correlationalism and humanist constructivism.$\backslash$nAssuming that this is indeed their agenda, I aim to remind MTT and their readers of three things. First, measuring mechanisms is only a part of thinking and working with the entities, properties, events, structures, and situations associated with the causal grittiness of mechanisms. Second, successful causal accounts combine mechanism-based explanations with variable-based explanations, linking processes to hypotheses.

abstract = {Campaigns play a central role in a democracy. I examine the effect of campaigns on the perception of the ideological positions of incumbent senators. The results demonstrate that incumbents affect voter perception both through their actions in office and on the campaign trail. Using the 1988 Senate Election Study, I find that the perceived location of incumbents depends on their roll call voting records, the perceived position of their party and the voter's own position. More crucial is the finding that candidates can affect the clarity of these perceptions through their campaign strategies. Incumbents who stress issues increase the clarity of voter perceptions, while challengers' attacks on incumbents reduce clarity. While elections alone increase clarity, these effects are small in comparison to the effect due to candidate campaign strategies. The results remind us that to understand the politics of elections we must incorporate candidate strategy in our models},

Most existing studies of terrorism are not well-equipped to answer this question as they lack an appropriate comparison. This paper compares the outcomes of civil wars to assess whether rebel groups that use terrorism fare better than those who eschew this tactic. Because terrorism is not a tactic employed at random, I first explore empirically which groups use terrorism. I find, contrary to the conventional wisdom, that terrorism is not a ``weapon of the weak,'' nor is it more likely to be used in secessionist conflicts. It is more likely to be used against democratic states, and in more populous and richer countries. Coming back to the initial empirical question, I find that while civil wars involving terrorism are harder to end than other wars, in those that do end, terrorist rebel groups fare no better, indeed they fare worse than non-terrorist groups. Terrorists do not win.},

abstract = {The spread, diffusion, spillover, or contagion of violent civil conflict – including insurgencies, coups, or other inter- nal armed conflict – across international borders is of great concern to civil war scholars and international security policymakers alike. For instance, great power military interventions are often predicated in part on the belief that if a given conflict is not stopped now, it may spread and destabilize an entire region. Nevertheless, our understanding of this phenomenon of ‘substate conflict contagion' is hindered by the lack of a comprehensive and accurate universe of cases. In this article I introduce an original dataset of cases and non-cases of substate conflict contagion between 1946 and 2007. The key difference between my dataset and other datasets of this phenomenon is that I require in my definition of contagion not only the spatial and temporal proximity of two conflicts, but also a documented causal link between them. After introducing the dataset and the process by which it was constructed, I show that substate conflict contagion by my definition is significantly less common than previous scholarship and policymaker rhetoric suggest, and that its correlates – and potentially the best methods with which to measure those correlates – are different from prior research as well. Policy implications are considered, and applications of this dataset for future conflict research are explored.},

Ehrlich, Sean D. 2007. `Access to protection: domestic institutions and trade policy in democracies,' International Organization, 61:3, pp. 571-605.

Summary
* Q: Existing research has focused on the difference between majoritarian and PR democracies; Ehrlich questions whether a more general argument can be made.
* H: As access points increase, the costs of lobbying fall, and policy is more likely to be protectionist
* M: panel regression of data on 21 OECD countries from 1948-94
* R: support for access points theory

Theory
* Existing work has theorised that PR systems insulate policymakers from protectionist demands (as they don't necessarily represent a district) and thereby should be more inclined to favour free trade, resulting in the state having lower levels of protection
* Yet, this blunt measure fails to account for the several majoritarian states with low levels of protection, and fails to account for the high degree of variation
* Ehrlich makes a more general claim based on the number of access points, which are the number of policymakers susceptible to lobbying. 
* When access points are numerous, the price of lobbying falls as the access points compete with each other for the lobbyists cash
* Ehrlich argues that protectionists are more easily able to overcome the collective action problem than free-traders, this is because the benefits of protection are concentrated and the costs dispersed, but the benefits of free trade dispersed and the costs concentrated 
* Therefore, protectionists will be more likely to take advantage of the low cost access, resulting in more protectionist foreign policy when access points are few. 
* The definition and operationalisation of `access point':
* A relevant policymaker who is also either independent or represents a specific political constituency
* Relevant means they have actual or potential policy power

Research design and results
* Model:
* DV: `tariff' -- revenue received from customs divided by the value of imports (trade-weighted average tariff)
* IV: differs by hypothesis

* Hypotheses:
* More electoral districts are associated with more protectionism
* As this adds access points
* IV: number of electoral districts
* Empirical result: Yes
* More parties in government are associated with more protectionism
* Increases the number of access points through increasing the number of relevant policymakers (likely party leaders)
* IV: raw number of parties in government
* Empirical result: Yes
* Low levels of party discipline are associated with more protectionism 
* Low party discipline makes more legislators independent, and thereby increases access points
* IV: uses a proxy called `pool' which measures the extent to which electoral votes pool across districts. In PR systems, once the top-list member has secured a seat, all additional votes are added to party candidates lower down. This means that an incentive for the party to do well exists, and little incentive exists to cultivate a personal vote in the district. This is a scale from 0 to 2, where 0 is a national list PR system, and 2 is no pooling.
* Empirical result: Yes
* After controlling for the number of electoral districts, the number of parties in governments, and the level of party discipline, PR is not associated with any change in protectionism
* i.e. PR v majoritarian literature is underspecified theoretically
* Empirical result: Yes, PR has no effect once the above is controlled
* Bicameralism is associated with more protectionism
* When the two houses are elected differently this should create additional access points
* IV: dummy for `effective' bicameralism
* Empirical result: No
* Presidentialism is associated with less protectionism
* If the legislature delegates trade policy to the president, then the number of access points is reduced. The president is assumed to be driven by national concerns, rather than the particular economic desires of constituencies and is thereby less likely to be protectionist
* IV: dummy
* Empirical result: Yes
* Left-wing governments are associated with more protectionism
* Whilst trade lobbying should follow specific-factor model (R-V), party ideology has long time horizons and thereby more closely resembles the mobile-factor model of S-S, therefore, left-wing parties which represent labour are more likely to be receptive to protectionist demands in advanced industrial countries (which are capital abundant but labour scarce), and so will encourage protectionist lobbying when in power resulting in higher tariffs.
* IV: dummy
* Empirical result: Yes

Points to consider
* Operationalisation uses tariffs, even though the theory is about trade policy. Three issues with trade-weighted average tariff:
* It can change without any policy change
* Extremely high tariffs can prevent any imports of a product, meaning that no tariffs are collected
* Tariffs are only one means of protectionism -- non-tariff barriers are missed from analysis, e.g. quotas, voluntary export restraints, onerous regulatory regimes
* Would theory hold in non-developed states?

Connections across readings and future research
* The major issue is matching up individual trade preferences and voter choice, to aggregations at the state level. I argue that, with the exception of Rogowski (1987) and Hiscox (2001) who are explicit in outlining that their theories are about cleavages, not voting, the other five papers require much greater treatment of this linkage.
* Hiscox's argument that factor mobility can vary from high to low (supporting either S-S or R-V respectively), is insightful, but does not appear to have been adopted to any great extent in subsequent works.
* That said, his theory may be criticised for being agnostic on which theory has greater explanatory power. For Hiscox, I would suggest greater specification of what high and low factor mobility looks like, how it can be measured, and how it ranges, would strengthen the paper.
* Individual voter preferences are shown to not be driven by rational economic self-interest by both Mayda and Rodrik 2005 and Ahlquist, Clayton and Levi 2014, the logical next step is to ask how individual preferences map on to voter choice.
* Unfortunately, I suspect that other issues trump the issue of trade for nearly all individuals in nearly all elections, with perhaps only those that have recently lost their job (or fearing loss) due to international competition (or the firm off-shoring) being likely to consider the issue to have primary political salience.
* Unpacking regime type, in particular for autocracies, is a clear necessity for Mansfield, Milner and Rosendorff (2000), and it would be especially useful to assess this breakdown in light of Ehrlich's theory, i.e. how well does access point theory explain the trade preferences of nondemocracies?},

abstract = {ABSTRACT What are the foreign policy consequences of China's growing trade relations? In particular, are states that trade more heavily with China more likely to side with it on key foreign policy issues? Does a shift toward China come at the expense of American influence? We evaluate these questions using data on bilateral trade for China and developing countries in Africa and Latin America between 1992 and 2006. Using ordinary and two-stage least squares to control for endogeneity, we present the first systematic evidence that trade with China generates foreign policy consequences. The more states trade with China, the more likely they are to converge with it on issues of foreign policy. This has implications for the United States, whose foreign policy preferences have diverged from those of China during the period of study and who may find it harder to attract allies in international forums.},

abstract = {Built environment is an essential component of traffic safety. Using data from the Georgia Department of Transportation from 2000 to 2007, the authors investigated the influence of built environment on pedestrian crashes in DeKalb County, Georgia, United States. A network-based kernel density technique was used to locate the hotspots of pedestrian crashes. An environmental audit was then conducted to provide a qualitative assessment of the built environment within each hotspot. Bivariate analysis and negative binomial models were utilized to examine the influence quantitatively after the road was partitioned into short road segments. Results show more pedestrian crashes were likely to occur on segments with less gradient change and with more public transit stops, and be close to census tracts with more public transit users, fewer seniors, and more linguistically isolated households. The findings emphasize the need for more extensive prevention campaigns around the hotspots and consideration of pedestrian safety in future urban and environmental planning.},

@article{Beardsley2012,
abstract = {This paper compares the explanatory power of two models of UN intervention behavior: (i) an “organizational mission model” built around the proposition that variations in the amount of resources that the UN devotes to different conflicts primarily reflect the degree to which a conflict poses a challenge to the UN's organizational mandate of promoting international peace and stability and (ii) a “parochial interest model” that revolves around the purely private interests of the five veto-holding members of the UN Security Council (the so-called P-5), i.e., interests that are either unrelated to or at odds with the UN's organizational mandate. Examining data on UN conflict management efforts in more than 270 international crises between 1945 and 2002, we find that measures of the severity and escalatory potential of a conflict are significantly better predictors of the extent of UN involvement in international crises than variables that measure P-5 interests that do not align with the UN's organizational mission of acting as a global peacemaker. This suggests that the UN adheres more closely to the humanitarian and security mission laid out in its Charter than critics of the organization often suggest.},

abstract = {To understand protest inAmerica, onemust understand protest and onemust understand America.More generally, the study of resistance against author- ity may adopt two foci: authority (structure) and resistance (action). The leading practitioners of the structuralist approach to contentious politics—McAdam, Tarrow, and Tilly—have jointly systematized their ideas. This synthesis, which I call Synthetic Political Opportunity Theory (SPOT), exerts domination and hegemony over the field. Its upstart rational action chal- lenger is theCollectiveActionResearch Program (CARP). I outline the basic presuppositions of SPOT and CARP and describe their different approaches to the structure-action problemof constituting social order. I then explore the potential of a CARP-SPOT consortium. I conclude that synergisms of the perspectives are possible but that trade-offs are inevitable: strong on action, weak on structure and vice versa; strong on resistance,weak on authority and vice versa; and strong on protest, weak on America and vice versa. Hence, we need creative confrontations, which should include well-defined combi- nations rather than grand syntheses, of rationalist and structuralist approaches to contentious politics.},

(1) The "residual" (total factor productivity, TFP) rather than factor accumulation accounts for most of the in- come and growth differences across countries. (2) Income diverges over the long run. (3) Factor accumulation is persistent while growth is not, and the growth path of coun- tries exhibits remarkable variation. (4) Economic activity is highly concentrated, with all factors of production flowing to the richest areas. (5) National policies are closely associated with long-run economic growth rates. These facts do not support models with diminishing returns, constant returns to scale, some fixed factor of production, or an emphasis on factor accumulation. However, empirical work does not yet deci- sively distinguish among the different theoretical conceptions of TFP growth. Econo- mists should devote more effort toward modeling and quantifying TFP.},

abstract = {This article introduces a new dataset on post-conflict justice (PCJ) that provides an overview of if, where, and how post-conflict countries address the wrongdoings committed in association with previous armed conflict. Motivated by the literature on post-conflict peacebuilding, we study justice processes during post-conflict transitions. We examine: which countries choose to implement PCJ; where PCJ is implemented; and which measures are taken in post-conflict societies to address past abuse. Featuring justice and accountability processes, our dataset focuses solely on possible options to address wrongdoings that are implemented following and relating to a given armed conflict. These data allow scholars to address hypotheses regarding justice following war and the effect that these institutions have on transitions to peace. This new dataset includes all extrasystemic, internationalized internal, and internal armed conflicts from 1946 to 2006, with at least 25 annual battle-related deaths as coded by the UCDP/ PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset. The post-conflict justice (PCJ) efforts included are: trials, truth commissions, repara-tions, amnesties, purges, and exiles. By building upon the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset, scholars interested in PCJ can include variables regarding the nature of the conflict itself to test how PCJ arrangements work in different environments in order to better address the relationships between justice, truth, and peace in the post-conflict period.},

Even in the absence of bias, missing data can hurt precision, resulting in wider confidence intervals. Analysts should examine the missing data pattern and try to determine the causes of the missingness. Modern software has simplified multiple imputation of missing data and the analysis of multiply imputed data to the point where this method should be part of any analyst's toolkit. Multiple imputation will often, but not always, reduce bias and increase precision compared with complete-case analysis. Some exceptions to this rule are noted in this review. When describing study results, authors should disclose the amount of missing data and other details. Investigators should consider how to minimize missing data when planning a study},
